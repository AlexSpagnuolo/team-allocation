# Choosing teams

## Overview

Self-organize into teams of 3 people. Each person on the team will be the lead of a specific segment of the project with a project manager guiding the whole project.

*Even though certain people are leads for segments every person must contribute to everything.*

Find team members in class who are strong in each different lead position. As a class you should distribute yourselves to make the best teams possible.

When you’ve found your team, come up with an awesome team name!

## Members

Please get into teams of 3, assigning each person one of these roles:

- Project Manager
- UX Lead
- Dev Lead

### If you must have 4 members

*4-member teams must first get approval from the teacher.*

- Project Manager
- UX Lead
- Visual Design Lead
- Dev Lead

### If you must have 2 members

*2-member teams must first get approval from the teacher.*

- UX Lead (PM for first half)
- Dev Lead (PM for second half)

## Team name

As a group, come up with an awesome team name that you can use on GitHub. In the next lesson we’ll be setting up the GitHub repository and organization—so you’ll need an team name.

The organization can also be customized with a logo—so it might be fun to make a fast logo for your team too.

## Hand in

Email your teacher with a roster of your team members, their roles within the project, your team name, and the organization’s URL.

*Probably best to do this after completing the [GitHub project setup lesson](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-6/github-project-setup/).*
