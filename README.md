# Choosing teams

Self-organize into teams of 3 people. Each person on the team will be the lead of a specific segment of the project with a project manager guiding the whole project.

*Even though certain people are leads for segments every person must contribute to everything.*

Find team members in class who are strong in each different lead position. As a class you should distribute yourselves to make the best teams possible.
