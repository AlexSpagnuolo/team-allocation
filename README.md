# Team allocation

## Overview

Teams will be randomly allocated into groups of 3 people. Each person on the team will be the lead of a specific segment of the project, with a project manager guiding the whole project.

*Even though certain people are leads for segments, every person must contribute to everything.*

When you’ve found all your teammates, together come up with an awesome team name!

## Members

Determine, based on your random group, which team member is strongest in each different lead position, and assign them a role:

- Project Manager
- UX Lead
- Dev Lead

---

## Team name

As a group, come up with an awesome team name that you can use on GitHub. In the next lesson we’ll be setting up the GitHub repository and organization—so you’ll need a team name.

The organization can also be customized with a logo—so it might be fun to make a fast logo for your team too.

## Hand in

Email your teacher with a roster of your team members, their roles within the project, your team name, and the organization’s URL.

*Probably best to do this after completing the [GitHub project setup lesson](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-6/github-project-setup/).*
